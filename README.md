## Hi there! I'm Jianing Zhang and welcome!

### Info About me
Hi! I’m Jianing Zhang and currently a Junior student studying Computer Science at the University of Washington, Paul G. Allen School.

I’m deeply keen on Artificial Intelligence and have done some research on CV and Optimization. Feel free to talk to me if interested!

Moreover, I am also interested in software development and had some projects on this topic as well, including an ongoing UW CIRCLE web app(in repository).
